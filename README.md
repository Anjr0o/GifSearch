# GifSearch by Andrew Stokes

A search engine for filtering and finding Gifs using GIPHY's third party API...

## Details
GifSearch is a site designed to demonstrate proficiency with the use of 3rd Party APIs and SCSS styling skills.
It features the use of GIPHY API to search for GIFs by entering keywords, rating, and number of GIFs desired.
The site is extremely easy to access.  Simply go to https://anjr0o.github.io/GifSearch

It also uses Unsplash API to generate a random background from a collection of texture backgrounds designed to allow easy visibility with web applications.

And as a finishing touch, I figured since this is a GIF site why not create a function to animate the favicon into a GIF! 

## Technologies Used
In addition to the APIs mentioned above, GifSearch was powered by Bootstrap, Sass, jQuery, and a small snippet of Linkedin's scripts for profile badges.

## Future Improvement
- I am not incredibly thrilled with the way the GIFs display on the page.  I am confident in my styling abilities but I will continue to keep an eye out for possible display ideas that are aesthetically pleasing to the eye.
- Could add ScrollSpy effect for Nav links
- Could use a library to allow the use of a regular GIF as a favicon for browsers like Firefox, which support GIF favicons
